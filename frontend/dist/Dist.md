# `dist/` Folder

The `dist/` folder is used to store the compiled, minified, and optimized files that are ready for production. This folder typically contains the final versions of CSS, JavaScript, and other assets that are generated from the source files in the `assets/` folder.

## Contents
- **`css/`**: Contains the compiled and minified CSS files.
- **`js/`**: Contains the compiled and minified JavaScript files.
- Other production-ready files: Additional optimized files, such as images or fonts, may also be included here depending on the build process.
