# Turing Academy - Turing.edu.az

Welcome to the Turing Academy repository. This project is designed to provide an intuitive and scalable frontend for the Turing.edu.az website, implemented using HTML and CSS, with a Django backend.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several folders, each with a specific purpose. Below is an overview of the key directories and documents within this repository:

### `/frontend/` Directory

The `frontend/` directory contains all the frontend-related files, including static assets, reusable components, layout templates, and page-specific HTML files. This directory is the heart of the project's user interface and design implementation.

- [Frontend Documentation](frontend/Frontend.md)

### `/frontend/assets/` Directory

The `assets/` directory within `frontend/` holds all static files necessary for the project, such as CSS, images, and fonts. This directory is further divided into subdirectories to organize these files efficiently.

- [Assets Documentation](frontend/assets/Assets.md)

#### `/frontend/assets/css/` Directory

The `css/` subdirectory contains all the stylesheets used in the project. It is structured to include base styles, component-specific styles, layout-related styles, and page-specific styles.

- [CSS Documentation](frontend/assets/css/CSS.md)

#### `/frontend/assets/js/` Directory

The `js/` subdirectory contains all the JavaScript files used in the project. It is organized to include global scripts, component-specific scripts, and utility functions.

- [JavaScript Documentation](frontend/assets/js/JS.md)

#### `/frontend/assets/images/` Directory

The `images/` subdirectory contains all the image files used throughout the project. This includes logos, background images, icons, and other visual elements.

- [Images Documentation](frontend/assets/images/Images.md)

#### `/frontend/assets/fonts/` Directory

The `fonts/` subdirectory stores custom font files used in the project. These fonts ensure a consistent typographic design across different browsers and devices.

- [Fonts Documentation](frontend/assets/fonts/Fonts.md)

### `/frontend/components/` Directory

The `components/` directory stores reusable HTML components, such as navigation bars and footers, that are utilized across multiple pages within the project. This allows for consistent UI elements and easier maintenance.

- [Components Documentation](frontend/components/Components.md)

### `/frontend/layouts/` Directory

The `layouts/` directory contains general layout templates that define the structure of the website's pages. These templates ensure a consistent look and feel throughout the project.

- [Layouts Documentation](frontend/layouts/Layouts.md)

### `/frontend/pages/` Directory

The `pages/` directory holds the individual HTML templates for each page on the website. Each file in this directory corresponds to a specific webpage and includes unique content and structure.

- [Pages Documentation](frontend/pages/Pages.md)

### `/frontend/dist/` Directory

The `dist/` directory is used to store compiled, minified, and production-ready files generated from the assets in the `assets/` directory. These files are optimized for deployment.

- [Dist Documentation](frontend/dist/Dist.md)

## Documentation Overview

Each major directory within the `frontend/` folder has its own detailed documentation file, named according to the directory (e.g., `Frontend.md`, `Assets.md`). These files provide comprehensive explanations of the contents and purpose of each directory.
